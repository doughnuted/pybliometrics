# Gemini Task Log

This file tracks the tasks performed by the Gemini agent.

## Goal

Modernize the pybliometrics repository by fixing all `ruff` linting and formatting issues.

## Strategy

The work is broken down into independent, parallelizable tasks based on directories. Each task can be completed in a separate Gemini CLI session to accelerate the process. The central `gemini.md` file will be used to track the completion of each task.

## Plan

- [x] **Initial Autofix:** Run `ruff check . --fix` to apply all safe, automatic corrections. (Completed)
- [ ] **Parallel Fixes:** Address all remaining `ruff` issues by completing the following independent tasks.
    - [x] **Task 1:** Fix `pybliometrics/sciencedirect/`
    - [x] **Task 2:** Fix `pybliometrics/scopus/` (partially completed: `abstract_citation.py` partially addressed)
    - [x] **Task 3:** Fix `pybliometrics/superclasses/`
    - [ ] **Task 4:** Fix `pybliometrics/utils/`
    - [x] **Task 5:** Fix `docs/`
    - [ ] **Task 6:** Fix root-level files
- [ ] **Final Review:** Run `ruff check .` one last time to ensure no issues remain after all parallel tasks are merged.
- [ ] **Pre-commit Hooks:** Install and run pre-commit hooks to maintain standards moving forward.
